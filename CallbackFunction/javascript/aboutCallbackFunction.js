/*

What is callback function ?
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

What is main thread blocking ?
This means that long-running JavaScript functions can block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page and a bad user experience. Unless intentionally using a web worker, such as a service worker, JavaScript runs on the main thread, so it's easy for a script to cause delays in event processing.

What is callback hell ?
Execute multiple asynchronous operations one after an after. By nesting callbacks functions.

What is inversion of control in javascript ?
Inversion of Control is an abstract programming principle based on the flow of control (execution of statements /instructions) that should be fully managed by the specific implementation of the framework, which is external to your code.
