What is Oops ?
Object-oriented programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm fundamental to many programming languages. Its three main concepts is classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.

What is constructor ?
A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.

What is class ?
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in javascript are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
 
What is inheritance ?
Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more. Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class. Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.
